# LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode Journey! This repository is where I document my progress, solutions, and learnings as I solve various coding challenges on LeetCode. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, deepen understanding of algorithms and data structures, and track my growth over time.

## 📌 About
- **Platform:** LeetCode
- **Language:** Primarily C (may explore other languages in the future)
- **Focus Areas:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Problem-Solving Techniques

## 📁 Structure
Each problem is organized in its own folder, named after the problem title or ID, and includes:
- Solution file(s)
- Problem description (optional)
- Explanation and complexity analysis (optional)

## 🚀 How to Navigate
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Peeyush1-lab/LeetcodeJourney.git
```
2. Browse the folders to find specific problems and solutions.
3. Run or test the solutions locally.

## 🌱 Why This Journey?
- To build consistency by solving problems regularly.
- To strengthen problem-solving skills.
- To prepare for coding interviews.

## 📌 Progress Tracking
I aim to solve problems across different difficulty levels:
- [ ] Easy
- [ ] Medium
- [ ] Hard

## 📖 Lessons Learned
I will document key learnings and patterns identified along the way.

## 🤝 Contributions
Feedback and suggestions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repo, open issues, or create pull requests.
